              <h3>How we reported this graphic</h3>
              <p>The Seattle Times asked the city of Seattle to provide a list of all of the public places where people can wash their hands, take a shower or use the restroom in Seattle. After receiving the cityâ€™s list, The Seattle Times contacted every homeless service provider to confirm information. Some service providers and locations were removed for the following reasons: only registered residents can access hygiene services (for example, the city included tiny house villages on its list, which are not open to the general public), the location is not designed to serve as a public drop-in center, and some park restrooms are currently closed due to long-term maintenance. From there, the list has been filtered to indicate if any member of the general public can access the facility or if a section of the population, like women and children, can access the services. A Seattle Times analysis showed that out of more than 100 locations, only seven offer shower services to the general public and only six have public restrooms open 24/7. And out of those six restrooms, three have running water.</p>
